# Flight Reservation System (1st Semester Java Project)

This repository contains my **first semester Java project**: a **Flight Reservation System**. It is a **console-based application** that allows users to **view available flights, book tickets, cancel bookings, and manage flights** (admin functionality). This project demonstrates fundamental Java programming concepts, including **object-oriented programming, arrays, file handling, and user input management**.

## Features

* View all available flights with details (ID, source, destination, price, seats left)
* Book a ticket and generate a ticket file
* Cancel a booked ticket
* Admin menu to add or remove flights
* Persistent storage of flights and bookings using text files (`flights.txt` and `bookings.txt`)
* Seat layout display (`O` = available, `X` = booked)

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheHassanBukhari/FLIGHT-RESERVATION-SYSTEM-1st-Semester-Java-Project-.git
```

2. **Compile all Java files:**

```bash
javac Project.java
```

3. **Run the program:**

```bash
java Project
```

> Make sure the `Data` folder exists, or the program will create it automatically when loading flights or bookings.
