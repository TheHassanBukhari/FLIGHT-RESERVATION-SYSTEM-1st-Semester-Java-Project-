# FLIGHT-RESERVATION-SYSTEM-1st-Semester-Java-Project-
This repository contains my first semester Java project: a Flight Reservation System. It demonstrates the basics of Java programming, including object-oriented concepts, user interaction, and data management. This project marks my first contribution to GitHub and serves as a foundation for my learning journey in software development.
